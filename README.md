# Responsive Portfolio 

I created a responsive personal portfolio that reflects my personality, and displays the skills that I have learned thus far. This assignment was fun, and very rewarding to create. I enjoyed being challenged to find different ways to style my page and make it completely functional. 

For this assignment I: 
   - Made a functional website 
       - All links in the navagtion bar work, and link to the appropriate pages  
       - All links to social media on the portfolio page are functioning and link to the respective sites
   - Used semantic HTML and the HTML is correct and valid 
   - Made the portfolio responsive to be suited for all devices 
       - Single photos that are in columns on a full screen will take up the entire page on a small screen 
       - The navagation bar will change to a hamburger menu on a small screen 
   - Created sticky footers for all pages 
   - Utilized Bootstrap for grid systems and components 
   - Contains my personal information 
       - Photos of me and my family 
       - Links to my social media 
       - An about me section featuring some facts about me and my life
